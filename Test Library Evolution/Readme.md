## Test `Build Libraries for Distribution` (failure)

This folder contains sample projects when built show the failure of "build libraries for distribition" in allowing compliation in future Swift versions. It contains a test project setup with framework (**TestEvolutionOld**) which contains a Swift static library inside (**TestStaticOld**) which it is accessing, and a shell App (**FunAppOld**) which consumes the framework (**TestEvolutionOld**). The framework and contained static library were both compiled with build libraries for distribution on the project and target level, but the resulting framework will not build in future Xcode versions (compiled in Xcode 12.5, will not build in Xcode 13.0).
