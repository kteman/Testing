This folder contains proof of failure of "build libraries for distribition" in allowing compliation with future Swift versions. It contains a test project setup with framework which contains a Swift static library inside which it is accessing, and a shell App which consumes the framework. The framework was compiled with build libraries for distribution, but will not build in future Xcode versions (compiled in 12.5, will not build in Xcode 13.0).
